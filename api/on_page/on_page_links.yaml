      description: "‌‌\nRedirect chains occur when there are at least two redirects between the initial URL and the destination URL. For example, if page A redirects to page B which redirects to page C, such a series of redirects is considered a redirect chain. Sometimes, if page B redirects back to page A, the redirect chain becomes closed and is considered a redirect loop.\nfor more info please visit 'https://docs.dataforseo.com/v3/on_page/redirect_chains/?bash'"
